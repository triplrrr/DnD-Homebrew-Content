# DnD-Homebrew-Content
The materials I create for D&amp;D, as well as other related materials. Anyone is allowed to submit a pull request and also suggest the removal of entries, but it must first be approved by myself or another editor of the repository. All credit will be given to those who create entries. 

This includes maps, items, spells, settings, campaigns, and any other materials I may use. Most will be homebrew or a revision to the already existing ruleset.
