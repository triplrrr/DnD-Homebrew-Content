# DnD-Homebrew-Content
The materials I create for D&amp;D, as well as other related materials.

This includes maps, items, spells, settings, campaigns, and any other materials I may use. Most will be homebrew or a revision to the already existing ruleset. 

File naming format is as follows: `name-of-object_type-of-object_edition_username`
Examples
* `boots-of-striding-and-springing_item_5e_wizards-of-the-coast`
* `fire-bolt_spell_5e_wizards-of-the-coast`
